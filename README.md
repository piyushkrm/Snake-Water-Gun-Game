# Snake-Water-Gun-Game
### The Snake-Water-Gun Game is a simple console-based Python project that simulates a popular hand game, similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this game, two players (typically the user and the computer) choose one of three options: Snake, Water, or Gun. The winner is decided based on predefined rules:

### Snake drinks Water → Snake wins.
### Water douses Gun → Water wins.
### Gun shoots Snake → Gun wins.
### If both players choose the same option, it's a draw.

## Key Features:
### Player vs. Computer: The user plays against a computer that randomly selects its choice.
### User Input Validation: Ensures the user inputs a valid choice.
### Scoring System: Keeps track of rounds won by the user and the computer.
### Replay Option: Allows users to play multiple rounds.
### Simple Logic: Uses conditionals to determine the winner for each round.
